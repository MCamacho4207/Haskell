This function seeks to generate the most efficient instruction sequence which raises a integer to thr n-th power. The algorithm which generates this sequence is based on the assumption that any given optimal sequence of n is the composition of the optimal sequences of it's prime factors. For example, the optimal sequence for raising an integer to the sixth power would be the composition of the optimal sequences of raising the integer to the second power and third power. This function is called with "optimalSequence n" where n is the number of the exponent of the integer to be raised to.
