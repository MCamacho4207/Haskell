This function uses an algorithm to find the nearest root of a polynomial given the root is within the interval given as a parameter. The function accepts a list of the form [a0,a1,a2,...,an] where a1,...,an are the coefficients of the polynomial of degree n where ai is the coefficient of the x term to the ith power. This function is called with "nearestRoot coeffs x1 x2 epsilon" where coeffs is the list of coefficients and x1 and x2 are the ends of the interval and epsilon is the convergence margin.
